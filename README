Monitors the performance of Rust incoming.

Heavily inspired by arewefastyet.com (including borrowing JS and
CSS!).

A fairly quick hack, doesn't do anything fancy, just hits the buildbot
JSON api and puts it into a database, and then (separately) constructs
a JSON file (`perf.js`, which sets the `PERF_DATA` global variable).

To initialise:

   sqlite3 perf.sqlite3 < perf.sql
   ./build-perf.py
   ./make-perf-json.py

This should make the `perf.js` file, and you're good to go, just open
`index.html` in your favourite browser. (The other option is to just
use the prebuilt version hosted by GitHub pages from this repo
http://huonw.github.io/isrustfastyet/)

Requires Python 3 and the requests library.

(To build historical data, change the HISTORY variable in
`build-perf.py`.)
